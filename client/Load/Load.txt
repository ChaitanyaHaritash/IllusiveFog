 Load-Plugin:Load stage a Payload in-memory on Victim Machine:
	
	-In any stealthy Operation need for using staged payload such as execution of
	raw byte-code(shell-code) or in memory execution of DLL (Dynamically Loaded 
	Libraries) or PE (Portable Executable) may arise,however we do not recommend 
	as it risks losing OpSec.many memory resident artifcats are left due to this.

	Load Plugin's pellets will be used to Load DLL/EXE for in-memory staging.
	after unloading Load Plugin,it will kill Stager's Process and delete the pellet so
	that no artifact may remain on disk or memory.
