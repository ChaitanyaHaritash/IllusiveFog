-ETW Plugin: Event Tracing for Windows is a feature that allows applications to
	collect logs about processes such as allocation of VADs,heaps,image load,
	network outgoing & incoming,disk,driver-load,process-creation,debug 
	prints,registry access and many other useful details.
	This feature is exploited to vital & rare intelligence about the 
	target.
	This feature not only allows one in a covert op to collect intelligence without
	risk of losing opsec but also use windows features more covertly.
	
	ETW-Providers subscriptions that enable to collect logs are also used by sysmon
	and windows defender (also known as ETW provider : Microsoft-Windows-Thread-
	Intelligence),mainly subscription to these ETW-Providers enable them to 
	collect logs about malicious activity,these ETW-Providers can be disabled so
	that windows-defender or sysmon will not receive any events about the process.
	Our research on usage and interaction between AV and ETW providers is in progress
	in-order to subvert these features for our benefit.
	Customer can expect updates on ETW plugin.
