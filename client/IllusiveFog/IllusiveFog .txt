IllusiveFog is designed for highly covert & stealthy operations,because of this
 reason features are kept limited and encryption is used to interact with c2,for
 every action there's a log,thus we've applied opsec checks at every interaction
 between c2 and mother(base implant).
 
 IllusiveFog is made to be highly focused on base framework itself(communication 
 between mother and c2,opsec checks and encryption).
 Techniques such as process-injection,shellcode process-injection or techniques that 
 risks losing opsec are avoided to  maintain opsec
